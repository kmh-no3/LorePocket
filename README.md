# LorePocket (iOS)

LorePocket is a daily card-drawing app that lets you collect wisdom, lore, and knowledge as cards.

## Important (Copyright / Datasets)

This repository contains the **app engine only**.  
Do **NOT** commit copyrighted quote datasets (e.g. book-derived texts).

- Public: code, schemas, and **original sample packs** only
- Private: your real datasets (Markdown/JSON/ZIP) should be kept locally

## Development Workflow (Recommended)

- Edit in Cursor (Windows/macOS)
- Run on **macOS + Xcode** (Simulator recommended)

## Import (Markdown -> Pack)

From the Pack list screen, tap **インポート** and select multiple `.md` files (e.g. `001.md` ...).

The app will parse the template described in `LorePocket_spec.md` and generate a private pack saved under the app's Documents directory.
